AI-Powered Traffic Control is a smart traffic management system that leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety. This project aims to automate traffic light control using real-time data and predictive analytics.

Features:
Real-time traffic analysis using computer vision
Dynamic traffic signal timing based on traffic density
Prediction of traffic congestion to optimize control strategies
Easy-to-use interface for monitoring and control
Scalable architecture for integration with city-wide traffic systems

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python, Java, C
Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV (for image processing), scikit-learn (for ML models), Pandas, NumPy
Developer Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
